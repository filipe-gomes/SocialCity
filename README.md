2) All humans are encouraged to make changes and enhance the platform
3) Any advertising must not interfere with regular human social intention

5) Human privacy and data retention must be clean and honest


## Revenue Generation is NOT FOR PROFIT

- Social City is a not for profit organization residing in the province of Ontario, Canada.
- Revenue is generated by taxing all transactions conducted on the virtual payment system at the rate of 0.01%.
- This tax is monitored, tagged and evaluated -- then given back to the community that needs it most, essentially redistributing wealth
- Example: Samantha transfers Ethan $10, the cost to Samantha is $10.10. $.10 is deposited into the SocialCity bank, on an centralized open source ledger
- After the organization operating costs are paid, the remainder is paid out to its users in the form of a dividend, intended to invest in community infrastructure

## End Goal of Social City

- To be a political platform for change.
- To be the change you want to see in the world.
- To be inclusive, everyone can contribute to the type of regulation and government they choose, by coding it.
- To be transparent; all source code must be open source and peer reveiwed with concensus on what updates are put in the master repository
- To transition the planet into a resource based econemy

## Resource Based Economey

- Social City will feature the most advanced user marketplace and virtual currency in the world
- You may upload local currency (for free-ish) and withdraw it (for a fee at your bank)
- It is preferable to leave your currency in Social City, much like other virtal currencies such as PayPal are known for, which costs nothing and increases the value of Social City
- The dividend tax collected from each transaction is put to use in systems such as the user market place, to help single mothers, the disabled and or humans in need
- Donations can also be made to the Social City infrastructure
